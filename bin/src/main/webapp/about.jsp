	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I am being inspired everyday by colours, feelings, people's
		faces, and important moments from my life. I believe that we should be
		able to find goodness in the simplest parts of our days. I prefer to
		paint on large surfaces and enjoy painting murals on a variety of
		materials including canvas, walls, and glass. I tend to paint with
		acrylics because they are very fluid and the colours are quite
		intense, allowing me to share my passion for colours in my creations
		and innovations. I hope that my paintings aptly share my ideas with
		the world and inspire people to focus on the simple things.</p>
